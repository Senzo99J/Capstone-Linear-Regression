> Read in the file dataset
> clean and preprocess the data
> Find whether there are missing values
> Check data types of each column to make sure there are no strings

> Explore the data with visualisations such as histograms and correlation metrics
> House Price VS Crime Rate
> Select and reshape data

> Explore relationships between the independent and dependent variables
> Visualize the Correlation  matrix heatmap
> Pair plots
> Scatter plots
> Adjust based on the number of columns

> Create a training and test set with 75:25 split ratios
> Display shapes
> Build a multiple linear regression model using 'rm' and 'lstat'
> Split the data
> Standardize the feature
> Build and Train the Model
> Make predictions and evaluate

> Print the model intercept and coefficients
> Generate predictions for the test set
> Make predictions and evaluate
> Evaluate the model

> Generate a plot
> Visualize the results
> Plot for 'rm' VS 'medv'
> Plot for 'lstat' VS 'medv'
